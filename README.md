# AGDQ 2016 Data
Code and Visualizations for processing AGDQ Donation Data. This is the complement to my blog post [Video Games and Charity: Analyzing Awesome Games Done Quick 2016 Donations](http://minimaxir.com/2016/01/agdq-2016/).

This also includes a Python script to scrape the Comment pages for data, as the amount of data was too big for Kimono to scrape properly.
